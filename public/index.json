I have tried my hands on vast variety of this in this industry including MicroServices, containers, Rest APIs, also worked on device side of this worked IPCs, microcontrollers( BLE, bootloader) and last but not least, differential privacy.\nI try my hands on code off-work as well. I recently, just a year back, setup a selfhosted server for hosting my website, storage and more. I learned quite a lot from that. I plan to use this website to write articles about my learning. This way I am storing my learning somewhere which might also be helpful for anyone visiting my site.\nOther than coding/development, I have a couple of hobbies.\nGaming: As expected from a software developer right?. I am currently playing Rocket league, grinding to become a champ. (Diamond 3 right now, just one step to go)\nParkour: I loved parkour as soon as I got to know about it. I might be around 10, when I first saw someone on TV, channel was National Geography or Discovery I think. I saw people doing flips (that was the only word I know at that time), and I was hooked. I started doing it on my own, starting with precision jumps (pre\u0026rsquo;s as we call it), high jumps and basic pakour rolls and valts.\nAchievement 1: I have done a backflip on concrete. Achievement 2: I have done front flip on sand. Achievement 3: I have done 10 ft. precision jumps. Achievement 4: I have done muscle up. Sketching: I used to sketch back in college, when I had quite some time. I have couple of realistic pencil sketching for my family and friends.\nDance: I was part of a dance crew back in College. Now, I don\u0026rsquo;t do it very often, so I can only do some basic stuff in bboying, popping, isolations and couple of well known moves like moon walk.\nI usually go with my life with this one quote.\nDo your best so you don\u0026rsquo;t regret.\nHopefully it inspires you as well :).\nDo not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions/inquiries or just want to talk.\n","date":"2 January 2024","permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"I am Software Development Engineer for around 5 years.","title":"About"},{"content":"Welcome to my blog.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Blog","summary":"Welcome to my blog.","title":"Blog"},{"content":"Here is the process I followed to setup my first website (this exact one!).\nI will be posting about each step in detail.\nI will assume that you have: # A domain (eg - \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt;.com), if you want to host publically.

I have been a Software Development Engineer for <script>document.write(calculateExperience())</script>. I have contributed in developing various products using micro-services architecture, containers for Distributed systems. I have also worked on embedded development where, I have played a key role in developing firmware for microcontroller with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality, specifically focusing on writing bootloader and setting up system for updating firmware Over-The-Air.

I also try my hands on development, off-work as well. Recently, a year back, I have setup a selfhosted server for hosting my website, storage and more. I learned quite a lot from that. I plan to use this website to write articles about things I learned from my experiences including selfhosting. This way I will organise my learnings here, which might also be helpful for anyone visiting my site.

Other than coding/development, I have a couple more hobbies including:
1. **Gaming**: As expected from a software developer right?. I am currently playing *Rocket league*, grinding to become a champ. (Diamond 3 right now, just one step to go). I am also playing *New World* on the side, my first MMORPG game, yay. 

2. **Parkour**: My love for parkour started as soon as I got to know about it. I might be around 10 years old, when I first saw someone on TV, channel was I think, National Geography or Discovery. I saw people doing flips (that was the only word I knew at that time), and I was hooked. I started trying to do parkour stuff on my own, starting with precision jumps (pre's as we call it), high jumps and basic pakour rolls and vaults. Here are couple of my achievements, or should I call it bucket list items, related to parkour or strength in some way.
    1. **Achievement 1**: I have done a backflip on concrete.
    2. **Achievement 2**: I have done front flip on sand.
    3. **Achievement 3**: I have done 10 ft. precision jumps.
    4. **Achievement 4**: I have done muscle up.
3. **Sketching**: I used to sketch back in college, when I had quite some time. I have done couple of realistic pencil sketching for my family and friends, I think those look good.
4. **Dance**: I was part of a dance crew back in College for my Bachelor's. Now, I don't do it very often, so now I think should be able to at least some basic stuff in bboying, popping, isolations and couple of well known moves like moon walk, haha, coz thats what attract everyone, right? myself included.

I usually go with my life with this one quote.

> Do your best so you don't regret.

Hopefully it inspires you as well :).

I am Software Development Engineer for around 5 years. I have tried my hands on vast variety of this in this industry including MicroServices, containers, Rest APIs, also worked on device side of this worked IPCs, microcontrollers( BLE, bootloader) and last but not least, differential privacy.

I try my hands on code off-work as well. I recently, just a year back, setup a selfhosted server for hosting my website, storage and more. I learned quite a lot from that. I plan to use this website to write articles about my learning. This way I am storing my learning somewhere which might also be helpful for anyone visiting my site.

Other than coding/development, I have a couple of hobbies.
1. **Gaming**: As expected from a software developer right?. I am currently playing Rocket league, grinding to become a champ. (Diamond 3 right now, just one step to go)

2. **Parkour**: I loved parkour as soon as I got to know about it. I might be around 10, when I first saw someone on TV, channel was National Geography or Discovery I think. I saw people doing flips (that was the only word I know at that time), and I was hooked. I started doing it on my own, starting with precision jumps (pre's as we call it), high jumps and basic pakour rolls and valts.
    1. **Achievement 1**: I have done a backflip on concrete.
    2. **Achievement 2**: I have done front flip on sand.
    3. **Achievement 3**: I have done 10 ft. precision jumps.
    4. **Achievement 4**: I have done muscle up.
3. **Sketching**: I used to sketch back in college, when I had quite some time. I have couple of realistic pencil sketching for my family and friends.
4. **Dance**: I was part of a dance crew back in  College. Now, I don't do it very often, so I can only do some basic stuff in bboying, popping, isolations and couple of well known moves like moon walk.

I usually go with my life with this one quote.

> Do your best so you don't regret.

Hopefully it inspires you as well :).

Here is the process I followed to setup my first website (this exact one!).

I will be posting about each step in detail.

#### I will assume that you have:
-  A domain (eg - \<your name\>.com), if you want to host publically.
-  Basic understanding about how a website works, like what is a webpage, server and domain provider etc.

It will be helpful in understanding what we will be doing.

        Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. This ensures the security and transparency of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It has the potential to revolutionize various industries by providing a secure and transparent way to record transactions.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">How Blockchain Works</h2>
      <p>
        Each block in a blockchain contains a number of transactions. When a new transaction occurs, it is added to a block. Once the block is complete, it is added to the chain in a linear, chronological order. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
      </p>
      <p>
        This structure makes it extremely difficult to alter any information on the blockchain, as changing a single block would require changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the majority of the network.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Applications of Blockchain</h2>
      <p>
        Blockchain technology has a wide range of applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Some of the most promising applications include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Supply Chain Management: Blockchain can provide a transparent and tamper-proof record of the journey of goods from the manufacturer to the consumer.</li>
        <li>Healthcare: Blockchain can securely store patient records and ensure that they are only accessible to authorized parties.</li>
        <li>Voting: Blockchain can provide a secure and transparent way to conduct elections, reducing the risk of fraud.</li>
        <li>Finance: Blockchain can streamline financial transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering costs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications of blockchain in various industries.
